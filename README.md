Bademail.io is a bot designed to analyze emails for phishing attempts and provide recommendations. It's a tool that helps users identify suspicious emails and understand the potential risks associated with them.

## How it Works

1. Forward an email to hi@bademail.io
2. The Bademail.io bot will analyze the email for phishing and provide recommendations.

The bot examines the email content, sender's details, and other relevant information to determine if the email is a phishing attempt. It then provides a verdict along with recommendations on how to handle the suspicious email.

## Note
